# TestGeometry

This is a test task about creating random circles, ellipses and helices in C++ using parametric form for curves and their first derivatives
All circles should be sorted radii ascending in another vector via pointers and sum radii must be counted

As I understood the task, circles and ellipses may have $z coordinate not zero, but first derivative $z is zero.
